particle gaps ( @xmath21 ) , a modulation of the shg output has been attributed to the modification of the electromagnetic field localization in the gaps @xcite . </S>\", \"<S> further , a large mismatch between the spatial period of the nanopillars @xmath22 and the resonant light wavelength @xmath23 rules out the excitation of propagating surface polaritons @xcite which are known to enhance the shg output @xcite . </S>\", \"<S> since all these effects are included in our simulations , we conclude that the origin of the observed shg enhancement is unrelated to the periodicity of the array .    </S>\", \"<S> an alternative scenario for the observed trend could invoke modifications of the non - local shg contribution enhanced by a regular array structure . </S>\", \"<S> the importance of the non - local shg was already demonstrated in a number of subwavelength - separated plasmonic nanoobjects @xcite . </S>\", \"<S> the amplitude and phase of this non - local shg source depends on the electric field distribution , i.e. on both the pillar size @xmath15 and the periodicity @xmath24 . </S>\", \"<S> as such , the interference conditions between the shg sources vary for different samples , thus resulting in a strong modification of the shg output .    </S>\", \"<S> further , the apparent difference in the shape of the resonant shg output for the 4h and 6h samples ( see fig .  [ shifts ] ) is related to the anisotropic nature of sic . </S>\", \"<S> the hexagonal sic polytypes are known to exhibit zone - folded weak modes in the reststrahlen region @xcite originating from particular stacking of the atomic layers along the _ </S>\", \"<S> c_-axis of the crystal @xcite . </S>\", \"<S> these weakly ir - active zone - folded modes can be visualised in the reflectivity measurements at oblique incidence @xcite . </S>\", \"<S> although zone - folded modes exist in both 4h and 6h polytypes , different stacking of the sic atomic layers is responsible for them having different frequencies , as illustrated in fig .  </S>\", \"<S> [ analysis],c - d . </S>\", \"<S> the additional periodicity in the crystal results in folding of the large brillouin zone thus modifying the phonon dispersion and making the excitation of phonons with non - zero wavevectors ( @xmath25 ) possible . </S>\", \"<S> it is seen in fig .  </S>\", \"<S> [ analysis],d that the zone - folded mode in the 6h - sic polytype with the reduced wavevector @xmath26 @xmath27 can be excited in the range of @xmath28  @xmath3 which is close to the typical monopole sphp resonant frequency of the sic nanopillars discussed above . </S>\", \"<S> in particular , the interaction of the sphp and zone - folded mode which shifted the apparent spectral positions of the monopole sphp eigenmode in the linear response @xcite , is seen responsible for the complex structure of the resonant shg output in our experiments ( fig .  </S>\", \"<S> [ shifts],d ) . </S>\", \"<S> the weak ir activity of the zone - folded modes is related to the large negative dielectric permittivity of sic in the reststrahlen band . as such , the out - of - plane component of the electromagnetic field @xmath10 remains small which inhibits the coupling of incident light to the zone - folded phonon mode . </S>\", \"<S> however , the excitation of the sphp monopole mode in the nanopillars drives a strong increase of @xmath10 , which facilitates the sphp monopole interaction with the zone - folded phonon ( fig .  </S>\", \"<S> [ analysis],c ) .    </S>\", \"<S> figure  [ analysis],a illustrates the effect of the zone - folded mode on the observed shg output . </S>\", \"<S> the open red squares ( 4h ) and blue circles ( 6h ) depict the shg intensity obtained at the sphp monopole ( resonant ) frequencies , and the dashed lines illustrate a clear correlation between the maximum shg output and the spectral position of the sphp monopole peak . </S>\", \"<S> similar trends are observed for the 4h and 6h - sic samples as long as the sphp monopole and the zone - folded mode are well - separated . </S>\", \"<S> when these two resonances start to overlap , an additional enhancement of the shg output produced at the sphp monopole resonance in 6h - sic samples is observed . </S>\", \"<S> moreover , the dependence of the shg signal at the frequency of the zone - folded mode @xmath29  @xmath3 ( green triangles ) exhibits a much faster increase when the two resonances are brought together ( dotted line ) , indicating an efficient interplay between the sphp monopole and the zone - folded mode .    </S>\", \"<S> we note that the interaction of the localized sphp eigenmodes and the intrinsic excitations of the medium is a unique fingerprint of mid - ir nanophononics . indeed </S>\", \"<S> , surface plasmon excitations in metals rely on the free electron gas , which is essentially isotropic . as such , the shg output of plasmonic nanostructures is ( i ) largely determined by the metal of choice , usually au , ( ii ) exhibits only weak spectral dependence @xcite and ( iii ) is limited by robust phase relations in the likely case of multiple shg sources @xcite . on the contrary , the flexibility of the sphps is provided by the coupling of the surface phonon polariton excitations to the intrinsic bulk phonon modes . the latter can be engineered by designing artificial metamaterials based on hybrid multilayer structures @xcite , thus allowing for an effective control of their optical properties . to summarize , </S>\", \"<S> we have observed shg output enhancement associated with the excitation of the sphp eigenmodes in an array of nanopillars grown from sic of different polytypes . </S>\", \"<S> the strongest shg output is associated with the excitation of the monopole sphp mode characterized by strong localization of the normal to surface projection of the electric field @xmath10 . </S>\", \"<S> the spectral positions of the shg peaks shift according to the geometric parameters of the nanophononic structures . </S>\", \"<S> we found a strong dependence of the magnitude of the shg enhancement on the resonant frequency . </S>\", \"<S> this experimentally observed dependence can not be quantitatively described by simply taking into account the sub - diffractional field localization and the dispersion of the linear and nonlinear optical properties of sic . </S>\", \"<S> further , we discuss the interplay of the sphps and the intrinsic crystalline anisotropy for an efficient nonlinear - optical conversion . this mechanism is supported by the shg spectral measurements on the 6h - sic nanopillars where excitation of the sphp monopole mode interacting with the weak zone - folded phonon resulted in an additional enhancement of the shg output . </S>\", \"<S> the presence of intrinsic resonances strongly alters the phase relations in their vicinity , providing a natural way for optimizing the shg response in a relatively narrow spectral range . </S>\", \"<S> our findings demonstrate high potential of mid - ir nonlinear nanophononics as a novel and promising platform for nonlinear optics and illustrate the rich opportunities it provides for efficient control over nonlinear - optical response .    </S>\", \"<S> the authors thank g.  kichin and a.  kirilyuk ( radboud university nijmegen ) for stimulating discussions . </S>\", \"<S> s.a.m . acknowledges the office of naval research , the royal society , and the lee -

radial - velocity amplitude @xmath24 for which 99% of planets would have been detected in the residuals .\", \"the eccentricity of the injected test signals was chosen to be the mean eccentricity of the surviving particles from the simulations described in   3.2 . only the regions in which test particles survived were considered in these limits computations .\", \"the results of these computations were highly varied , reflecting the differing observing strategies employed for these six objects .\", \"in particular , hd  3651 , hd  80606 , and hd  89744 were monitored intensely with the het as part of a search for short - period objects , whereas hd  37605 and hd  45350 were only observed sporadically after the known planet orbits were defined and published @xcite , and 16  cyg  b has only been observed with the hjs telescope at a frequency of at most once per month .\", \"the companion limits are shown in figures  4 - 6 ; planets with masses above the solid line can be ruled out by the data with 99% confidence .\", \"not surprisingly , the tightest limits were obtained for hd  3651 ( figure  4 ) , which had a total of 195 measurements , including 29 independent het visits .\", \"for periods less than about 1  year , we can exclude planets with m  sin  @xmath21  2 neptune masses .\", \"similar results were obtained for 16  cyg  b ( n=161 ) , where the limits approach a neptune mass ( figure  6 ) .\", \"since the detection limits generally improve with the addition of more data and with higher - quality data , we can define a quantity to measure the goodness of the limits .\", \"a simple choice would be @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the total number of observations , and @xmath27 is the mean uncertainty of the radial - velocity measurements .\", \"the values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are given in table  2 .    in the hd  45350 system , the results of the dynamical simulations complement those of the detection limit determinations .\", \"very tight limits are obtained in close orbits ( @xmath280.2  au ) . in this region ,\", \"test particles were stable ( fig .  2 ) and our observations can exclude planets with m  sin  _ i _ between about 1 and 4 neptune masses .\", \"similar results were obtained for the 16  cyg  b system , in which test particles remained stable inward of @xmath29  0.3  au . in that region ,\", \"planets of 1 - 3 neptune masses can be excluded by our limits determinations ( fig .\", \"6 ) . in most of the limits determinations\", \", there are multiple `` blind spots '' evident where the periodogram method failed to significantly recover the injected signals .\", \"typically this occurs at certain trial periods for which the phase coverage of the observational data is poor , and often at the 1-month and 1-year windows .    for none of hd  37605 ( fig .  4 ) , hd  80606 ( fig .  5 ) , or hd  89744 ( fig .\", \"6 ) could additional companions be ruled out below about 0.7 , and for most orbital periods tested , the limits were substantially worse .\", \"one possible explanation for this result is that the sampling of the observations was poorly distributed in phase for many of the injected test signals , making significant recovery by the periodogram method difficult .\", \"this is evidenced by the `` jagged '' regions in the plots .\", \"also , the intrinsic scatter for those three systems was too large to permit tight limits determination .\", \"this is certainly reasonable for the f7 star hd  89744 .\", \"the three systems with the best limits ( hd  3651 , hd  45350 , and 16  cyg  b ) also had the lowest rms scatter about their orbital solutions ( mean=@xmath30 ; table  1 ) .\", \"in contrast , the mean rms for the remaining three systems was @xmath31 .\", \"additional factors such as a paucity of data ( hd  37605 ) and short time baselines ( hd  80606 , hd  89744 ) made the determination of useful companion limits challenging for some of the planetary systems in this study .\"], [\"we have shown that for a sample of six highly eccentric extrasolar planetary systems , there is no evidence for additional planets .\", \"test particle simulations show that there are regions detectable by current surveys ( i.e.  for @xmath32 au ) where additional objects can exist . for hd  3651 and hd  37605\", \", we find that protected resonances are also present .\", \"combining these simulations with detection limits computed using new high - precision het data combined with all available published data is particularly effective for the hd  3651 and hd  45350 systems .\", \"additional short - period planets can be ruled out down to a few neptune masses in the dynamically stable regions in these systems .\", \"this material is based upon work supported by the national
